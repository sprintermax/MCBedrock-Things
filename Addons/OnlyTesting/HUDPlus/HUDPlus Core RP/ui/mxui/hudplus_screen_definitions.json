/* --> INFO AND EXAMPLES
  - The global prefix for the pack is '_hud+:', this must be the first thing on the message sent to the client.
  - Curreently HUD elements can be controlled with titles, subtitles and chat messages. Plans to add scoreboards, item tooltip texts and more in the future.
  - A global prefix to show or hide the vanilla HUD is available by using '_hud+:HideUI' and '_hud+:ShowUI' (Case sensitive).
  - Messages that start with the prefix `_hud+:` will be hidden from vanilla texts and chat views.
  
  - Title controled panels can not have single-run animations due to if the animation is finished and doesn't loop, it will not run again, even if the screen is not visible. (Note that title animations is a WIP and will be changed in the future)
  - Chat animations can have single run animations, and the chat element based is set to self destruct after some time (default 3).

  - Recomended to use title controls for static elements, and chat messages for notifications and/or fast screen elements.

  - Examples:
  --- /titleraw @a title {"rawtext":[{"text":"_hud+:HideUI"}]}
  --- /titleraw @a title {"rawtext":[{"text":"_hud+:ShowUI"}]}

  - (remember that custom screen identifiers MUST be exactly 8 digits)
  --- /titleraw @a title {"rawtext":[{"text":"_hud+:+:CinemBar"}]}
  --- /titleraw @a title {"rawtext":[{"text":"_hud+:-:CinemBar"}]}

  --- /titleraw @a title {"rawtext":[{"text":"_hud+:Message0"}]}
  --- /titleraw @a title {"rawtext":[{"text":"_hud+:Message1"}]}

  - (aditional text can be included after the hud+ values to pass more data if you want)
  --- /titleraw @a title {"rawtext":[{"text":"_hud+:MyNPCBob"},{"translate":"npc.bob.message0"}]}

  - (chat based control)
  --- /tellraw @a {"rawtext":[{"text":"_hud+:NotiMsg0"},{"translate":"notification.achievement.complete"}]}
